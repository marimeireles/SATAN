#SATAN ðŸ˜ˆ

##Sentiment Analyses Tool And Net-crawler

SATAN is a tool written in Rust to scrape the internet and give you the overall sentiment of a [website] over a [word].

**Note:** If you're curious about the origin of the name of this package, don't worry! It's not a blasphemy! (or at least, not intended as such). It was just a coincidence between the purpose of the tool and this unholy word.
